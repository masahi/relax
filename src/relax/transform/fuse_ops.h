 * \file src/relax/transform/fuse_ops.cc
 * \brief This file contains a pass which groups bindings in a dataflow block of Relax
 * functions and generate a new grouped Relax function for each group, according to the fusion
 * algorithm described below. By grouping bindings into new Relax functions, we substitute the
 * bindings in the function being manipulated into function calls to the new grouped function.
 *
 * A follow-up pass named "FuseTIR" will generate a TIR PrimFunc for each grouped function.
